The Numbers
===
The folder number refers to the build number on the CI server.

I will only be posting builds that I am happy with.

What to download
===
If you are a **server owner** download ParadiseSurvivalGames.jar

If you are a developer and want to use the API, download original-ParadiseSurvivalGames.jar
